# Skybound Realms Java Client - Verification Guide

## Task 14.1 Verification Checklist

This document helps verify that the basic Java project and window functionality has been implemented correctly.

### ✅ Project Structure Created
- [x] Maven project with proper pom.xml
- [x] Main class at `src/main/java/com/skybound/client/Main.java`
- [x] Test class at `src/test/java/com/skybound/client/MainTest.java`
- [x] Build scripts (build.bat, run.bat)
- [x] Documentation (README.md)

### ✅ Dependencies Configured
- [x] LWJGL 3.3.3 for window management and OpenGL
- [x] Platform-specific native libraries (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- [x] JUnit 5 for testing
- [x] Maven plugins for compilation and execution

### ✅ Main Class Features
- [x] LWJGL initialization with error handling
- [x] Window creation (1024x768 resolution)
- [x] OpenGL context setup
- [x] Basic game loop with delta time calculation
- [x] ESC key handling for graceful shutdown
- [x] Proper resource cleanup

### ✅ Requirements Compliance

**Requirement 1.1**: Private Island System
- The window serves as the foundation for displaying the player's private island
- Basic rendering context is established for future 3D world display

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Install Maven** (if not already available):
   ```bash
   # Download from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
   # Add to PATH environment variable
   mvn -version  # Should show Maven version
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

4. **Verify window behavior**:
   - Window should open with title "Skybound Realms"
   - Window size should be 1024x768 pixels
   - Background should be sky blue color
   - Console should show "Starting Skybound Realms Client..."
   - Console should show "Window initialized successfully!"
   - Console should show "Press ESC to close the window"

5. **Test ESC key functionality**:
   - Press ESC key while window has focus
   - Console should show "ESC pressed - closing window"
   - Window should close gracefully
   - Console should show "Cleaning up resources..."
   - Console should show "Skybound Realms Client closed successfully"

6. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

### Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
Starting Skybound Realms Client...
Window initialized successfully!
Press ESC to close the window
ESC pressed - closing window
Cleaning up resources...
Skybound Realms Client closed successfully
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Maven not found
- **Solution**: Install Maven and add to PATH

**Issue**: Window doesn't open
- **Solution**: Ensure graphics drivers are up to date and OpenGL 3.3+ is supported

**Issue**: Build fails with native library errors
- **Solution**: Check that the correct platform profile is being used in pom.xml

### Next Steps

After verification, the next task (14.2) will add:
- HTTP client dependency (OkHttp)
- ApiClient class for REST API communication
- Connection to backend health check endpoint
- Display connection status in window title
